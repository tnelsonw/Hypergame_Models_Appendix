Figure A10 shows the HNF results for lateral movement with HEU(E) substitution, where E means exfiltration hypergame from Figure A5.

## Figure A11

![](GNE_privesc_HEU.png)

Figure A11 shows the HNF results for privilege escalation with HEU(LM) substitution, where LM means lateral movement hypergame from Figure A10.

## Figure A12

![](GNE_persistence_HEU.png)

Figure A12 shows the HNF results for persistence with HEU(PE) substitution, where PE means privilege escalation hypergame from Figure A10.

## Figure A13

![](GNE_init_exploit_HEU.png)

Figure A13 shows the HNF results for initial exploitation with HEU(P) substitution, where P means persistence hypergame from Figure A12.

## Figure A14

![](ch7_exfil_init.png)

Figure A14 shows an HNF example filled in with information from the *hypergame analysis* step. The red boxes indicate the portion of the HNF to be filled in during this step. 

## Figure A15

![](ch7_exfil_adv_profile.png)

Figure A15 shows an HNF example filled in with information from the *adversary profiling via hypergame* step. The red boxes indicate the portion of the HNF to be filled in during this step. 

## Figure A16

![](ch7_exfil_discuss_results.png)

Figure A16 shows an HNF example filled in with information from the *discuss hypergame results* step. The red boxes indicate the portion of the HNF to be filled in during this step.

## Figure A17

![](ch7_exfil_updated_game.png)

Figure A17 shows an HNF example filled in with information from the *update hypergame information* step. The red boxes indicate a portion of the HNF that can be updated during this step. Contrast with Figure A17.
